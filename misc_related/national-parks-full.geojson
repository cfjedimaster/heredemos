The Maze district, in the west of the park, is the most remote and challenging. You can reach The Maze via unpaved roads from UT 24.","entrancePasses":[{"cost":"55.0000","description":"Valid for one year through the month of purchase.

In winter, freezing temperatures and strong winds can be expected, with rain and snow in the mountains. With enough moisture, spring wildflowers may carpet the desert floor with vivid colors. Summers are hot, and temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit are typical. In summer, adventurers head for the higher elevations such as Mid-Hills and the New York Mountains. The cooler temperatures of fall mark hunting season.","name":"Mojave","operatingHours":[],"topics":[{"id":"0D00073E-18C3-46E5-8727-2F87B112DDC6","name":"Animals"},{"id":"7F81A0CB-B91F-4896-B9A5-41BE9A54A27B","name":"Archeology"},{"id":"E06F3C94-AC8A-4B1C-A247-8EBA8910D5EE","name":"Astronomy"},{"id":"957EF2BD-AC6C-4B7B-BD9A-87593ADC6691","name":"Birds"},{"id":"DC053312-4F5B-430E-831F-B939FA6E8E8E","name":"Buttes"},{"id":"2539614A-9646-446E-8251-34D3AAE068FA","name":"Cats (wild)"},{"id":"1170EEB6-5070-4760-8E7D-FF1A98272FAD","name":"Commerce"},{"id":"CDD8F34E-3BD4-425A-8264-4F0BA0DFBA38","name":"Dunes"},{"id":"489D6333-FD72-44DF-83B0-3D4412DD0A75","name":"Endangered"},{"id":"1F833C99-A75D-4F9E-9256-B96523485466","name":"Farming and  Agriculture"},{"id":"04A39AB8-DD02-432F-AE5F-BA1267D41A0D","name":"Fire"},{"id":"1608649A-E7D7-4529-BD83-074C90F9FB68","name":"Fish"},{"id":"0E1A04CC-EB51-4F18-93D4-EC0B0B4EC1E3","name":"Freshwater Springs"},{"id":"F0F97E32-2F29-41B4-AF98-9FBE8DAB36B1","name":"Geology"},{"id":"4BE01DC5-52E6-4F18-8C9A-B22D65965F6D","name":"Groundwater"},{"id":"D1722DD1-E314-4B6D-8116-DED86305C4A4","name":"Homesteading"},{"id":"0B575E33-B68F-4F3D-998E-B03284606CF3","name":"Industry"},{"id":"3B0D607D-9933-425A-BFA0-21529AC4734C","name":"Military"},{"id":"BDC806A8-5470-4A8B-A0F9-CD804BE3028A","name":"Mining"},{"id":"BEB7E470-13B2-4E00-84B2-0402D98DAF69","name":"Monuments and Memorials"},{"id":"101F4D51-F99D-45A6-BBB6-CD481E5FACED","name":"Mountains"},{"id":"A1BAF33E-EA84-4608-A888-4CEE9541F027","name":"Native American Heritage"},{"id":"A7359FC4-DAD8-45F5-AF15-7FF62F816ED3","name":"Night Sky"},{"id":"E4E84C87-6737-4C37-9157-5962648A35F2","name":"Ranches"},{"id":"4244F489-6813-4B7A-9D0C-20CE098C8FFF","name":"Rock Landscapes and Features"},{"id":"A0C86055-4C79-4F70-9D2E-6B9B738290D0","name":"Ruins"},{"id":"9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B","name":"Scenic Views"},{"id":"393F60FB-80D6-46F7-B0FB-BBF3C90F59FD","name":"Tortoises and Turtles"},{"id":"A010EADF-78B8-4526-B0A4-70B0E0B3470E","name":"Trade"},{"id":"86525CF5-EB56-41A6-90BF-566C6C0FC945","name":"Trains and Railroads"},{"id":"FE2C2613-B41E-4531-BC43-03EB6E45CBCF","name":"Transportation"},{"id":"78E4F4AC-AF97-435A-8C2C-7FB8D67516ED","name":"Unique Species"},{"id":"97CCB419-196C-4B95-BB3A-621458F78415","name":"US Army"},{"id":"90F8744F-CD10-4925-955C-064CB1A17EB0","name":"Volcanoes"},{"id":"C9C749E3-39C3-45F7-BCC5-9A609E30AA05","name":"Westward Expansion"},{"id":"B85866E2-0897-4000-9040-605CA335804F","name":"Wilderness"}],"latLong":"lat:35.12485941, long:-115.5168258","description":"Singing sand dunes, cinder cone volcanoes, Largest Joshua tree forest, and carpets of spring wildflowers are all found within this 1.6-million-acre park.
